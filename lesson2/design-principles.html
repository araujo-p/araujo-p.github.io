            <p class="principle-description">The headings are big and the text is small, which makes you know exactly where to start reading and in which direction you should continue reading the get the information you need. The principle was well applied and as result fulfill its purpose.</p>

          <p class="principle-description">It is a simple layout page but you will the principle of repetition in it: the brand name right on top of the page and repeating on the notebook screen. You may notice that your always are draw by the to places where the brand shows up on the page which will make if easier for you to keep that image on your mind.</p>

          <img class="samsung-img" src="images/samsung.jpg" alt="Samsung website schreenshot">
          <h4 class="website-name">Samsung</h4>
          <p class="website-link"><a href="https://www.samsung.com/br/" target="">www.samsung.com/br</a></p>
          <p class="principle-description">The site uses a lot of black and white which create a great contrast making the page look fancy and also helps us pay more attention to what it wants to sell, which is the Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. The principle was well used and it created a perfect harmony with the fonts used in the page. I also help us see where to start reading.</p>
