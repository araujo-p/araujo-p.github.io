        <h2> Site Name</h2>
        <p>weather yourself. I chose this name because I wanted to be like a verb, like when you say improve yourself, but in this case, is inform yourself about the weather on your location or weather yourself.</p>

        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The website is created to provide information about the weather and also to share experiences from citizens about the different kinds of weather, tips about how to prepare for a snow storm, a tornado, or any other extreme situation that may occur in some areas. It is created to be easy to use for any people from any age.</p>
